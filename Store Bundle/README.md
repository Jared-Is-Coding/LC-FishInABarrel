## Suggested Hide N Seek Rules

### Hiders
- Hiders are given until 10am to hide *within* the facility
- Hiders must enter through the main entrance or inverse teleporter
- Hiders must not exit the facility after entering
- Hiders can optionally tinker with the facility by disabling light panels or removing the apparatus
- Hiders can optionally use keys
- Hiders can optionally use flashlights

### Seeker(s)
- Seekers must not enter the facility until 10am
- Seekers must not use the ship monitor to find hiders
- Seekers must only enter the facility through the main entrance
- Seekers can optionally carry a flashlight or boombox in their dedicated item slots

### Gameplay and Winning
- As a seeker, if you kill all hiders you receive a point.
- When one hider is left, the deceased hiders must vote for the ship to leave. If the remaining hider survives until the ship has left, they receive a point.
- In the event the seeker dies, all remaining hiders receive a point.
- Play as many rounds as you like. The employee with the most points at the end is the winner.

## To-Do

- Add built in points tracking
- Add overlay for points display
- Allow configuration of mod adjustments in settings menu
