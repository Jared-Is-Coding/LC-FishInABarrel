## Suggested Hide N Seek Rules

### Hiders
- Hiders are given until 10am to hide *within* the facility
- Hiders must enter through the main entrance or reverse teleporter
- Hiders may not exit the building after entering
- Hiders may not use flashlights
- Hiders may tinker with the facility by disabling light panels or removing the apparatus
- Hiders may use keys

### Seeker(s)
- Seekers may not enter the facility until 10am
- Seekers may optionally carry a flashlight or boombox in their dedicated item slots
- Seekers may not use the ship monitor to find hiders

### Gameplay
- As a seeker, if you kill all hiders you receive a point.
- When one hider is left, the deceased hiders can vote for the ship to leave. If the remaining hider survives until the ship has left, they receive a point.
- In the event the seeker dies, all remaining hiders receive a point.
- Play as many rounds as you like. The one with the most points at the end is the winner.
